Please create a stylesheet for me that can be used with this file. I would like the page to be themed after the art of the Yugioh card "Macro Cosmos". On top of that, here is the layout I'd prefer for the finished product.
I would like to have a picture of me in the very top of the page as a reasonably sized circle.
Under that, I want my name to be centered under my picture.
Then I would have my 5 nav links all in a single row that is properly spaced.
After this comes the "About Me" section.
Start with the "About Me" header, and ideally you would be able to have my bio text laid on top of the bottom portion of the picture like some sort of caption.
Next, I would like an image of the school and it's location on a map side by side.
Scrolling down further, the Education section.
Neatly align the rows and columns me for with the contents of each row in their respective columns.
I would then like a section dedicated to the courses I've taken, and you can just list them out, but don't actually make a bulleted list.
Then, I would like you to put the Skills, Extracurriculars, and and Hobbies sections on the same row, and then have the form centered and directly below the middle of those elements.
Lastly, the "return to the top" button should be directly to the right of the form.

can you edit in comments explaining what parts do what
