Assignment 5: Web Development - Final Project
I'm not even sure where to begin. First and foremost, I worked on a variety of frontend and bankend, but my work mostly pertained to the views tab of the project. Models of real world objects are created, my job is to make the pages that allowed for the visualization of the interactions of objects and the database. This was my first real CS group project for the most part, and it wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be! All of the github issues that were discussed in class thankfully didn't happen to me since I worked on a different section of the project. One thing that did come up though was debugging code from other users. I remember spending so much time looking back and forth between app.js and what I was working on, only to discover that the routes weren't working because of a difference of literally a single character. Everything from routes, models, my views folder were named "customer" but the defined route in app.js was /customers. After that, I had lot's of fun figuring out how to connect things from and to MongoDB.
