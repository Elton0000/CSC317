Portfolio Styling Assignment: Human vs. AI CSS Challenge
Description:
Now that we've learned quite a bit of CSS, the idea is to upgrade our plain HTML documents to something that pops out more. Should look closer to a website than a google doc now.

Approach / What I Did:
I took my time going from top to bottom, and did the changes in chronological order. First, I started with my own picture. From here, I would learn about how containers and individual IDs interacted with each other, while also learning about what different css styles did. The next significant part was when I started working on my navigation links. I learned more about the "display:flex" styling, and experimented with hover effects. This is prompted me to go back to make picture, because what I was originally aiming for was to have my own face disappear and be replaced by a yellow star. I tried to make the Vietname flag with overlaying effects, but unfortunately was not able to. Moving down to the About me section, now I was centering images and text. It was here when I first used animations like "scale()" and I later applied this to my navigation section as well. Moving on to the school section, I was trying to find a way to make whole images be able to redirect to another site, and I eventually stumbled across a solution that I liked on Overstack. The idea was to have hyperlinked text, set a background image on that, and then hide the text. I'm sure there was a more efficient way to do that, but it was fun to figure out. The rest of the CSS is me trying to cut as much empty space as possible, while repeating what I did for the first half of it.

Discussion:
I learned how to apply CSS to HTML files, and the importance of knowing how selectors work, and how specific you need to be sometimes. 

Version:
Honestly, I think the hybrid allowed for the most thought provoking moments, but writing the CSS by myself was where I learned the most. So if I had to pick, I prefered writing my own CSS file because it was the most stimulating? It feels good when you have an idea and the code finally clicks.
